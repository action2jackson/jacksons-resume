        <h2>me</h2>
        <p>HELLO, my name is Jackson Lintz and im a 17 year old junior in highschool, currently enrolled in the IB (international Bacclereate) program. I am a friendly, outgoing guy who loves positivity and learning. I am not a partier, im a grinder, who loves the process of doing, creating and just working in general.</p>
        <h2>A Day In The Life</h2>
        <p>I try to consistently wake up at around 5am every day and execute my morning routine (shower, brush teeth, journal, eat). After my morning routine i code until i have to go to my first class. Sometime during school i workout for 1 hr. After school I go home and send out emails for my brothers company (highkeyco). After that I get back to coding, so i can start and end my day with programming.</p>
        <h2>Sports</h2>
        <p>I like to play a variety of sports, instead of focusing on 1. The main sports I play are basketball, spikeball, golf, handball and football. I currently play basketball with my 2 older brothers in a mens league, which is semi-competetive. Last year I competed in a couple golf tournaments and ended up getting a 1st and 2nd place. The only sport this year I played for my school was handball. All the other sports I listed are just for fun with friends.</p>
        <h2>Passion for programming</h2>
        <p>Last year the first things I learned about programming were <em>html</em> and <em>css</em> on codecademy. This helped me learn how to make beautiful static websites, until I came across the platform wordpress, which is were I make my websites now. After learning about the fundamentals of front-end development, I started learning about Python and Javascript in a course that I enrolled in. From these languages I know, and have built C.R.U.D functionality apps.</p>
        <p>I have a drive for self-education and programming that motivates me to enhance my knowledge of the languages that im embedded in and create awesome projects for the clients im working with.</p>
        <h2>Coaching/Teaching</h2>
        <p>I love working with other people and teaching, and I promise my optimism and positivity will rub off on you. You can contact me through email or over the phone. I would be glad to talk FOR FREE, to you for 10-15min to see if were the right MATCH!</p>
